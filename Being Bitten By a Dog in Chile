Being Bitten By a Dog in Chile

I wanted to give a detailed yet succinct writeup of my experiences with street dogs, being bitten, the threat of rabies and my care as a resource to anyone that goes through a similar incident. Please note I am not a doctor, and this should not be taken as medical advice. This is just learnings I personally have come to in my experience getting bitten by a dog in Chile.

== Background
I am an avid dog lover. Anyone who knows me, knows I am open and kind to dogs of all breeds and sizes. If you want further proof, I recommend looking at #kevwithpups
